| Example module | If you'd like to develop your own module for indigo-player (apply own business rules, integrate an ad provider, write new media support, ...), take a look at this sample project. | https://github.com/matvp91/indigo-player-extension-example |

## Getting started

The example below will load a simple MP4 file, and attempt to autoplay it.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="playerContainer"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/indigo-player@1/lib/indigo-player.js"></script>
    <script>
      const config = {
        sources: [
          {
            type: 'mp4',
            src: 'https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4',
          }
        ],
      };

      const element = document.getElementById('playerContainer');
      const player = IndigoPlayer.init(element, config);

      // You can use the player object now to access the player and it's methods (play, pause, ...)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
